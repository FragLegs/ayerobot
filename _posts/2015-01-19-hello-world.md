Aye, Robot will be a site where I can discuss random thoughts on machine learning, from experiments that I am working on, to papers I am reading, to general advice/issues.

I hope you enjoy it. If you have any questions/comments, please drop me an email at miel(dot)shayne(at)gmail(dot)com.

$$\frac{\partial P(\tilde n,t)}{\partial t} = - \underbrace{\frac{\partial \left( b(\tilde n)-d(\tilde n) \right)}{\partial \tilde n}}{A(\tilde n) } \frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde n} \tilde n P(\tilde n,t)+ \underbrace{\frac{b(\tilde n)+ d(\tilde n)}{2} }{B(\tilde n)/2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \tilde n^2} P(\tilde n) \label{forward}$$
